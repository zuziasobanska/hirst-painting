# Hirst Painting
# Python scripting practice using the Turtle graphics library

I created this project to practice using Python scripting. I used the Turtle graphics library to create a digital representation of a painting inspired by the artist Damien Hirst. The painting is basically a grid of randomly coloured dots on a blank canvas.

## How It Works

I created an object named `paintbrush` from the Turtle class, that moves across the canvas, creating a grid of dots with random colours. The colours are chosen from a predefined list of RGB tuples. 

## Customize

Feel free to modify the script to experiment with different colors, dot sizes, or grid configurations. You can also adjust the speed of the drawing by changing the `paintbrush.speed()` parameter.
